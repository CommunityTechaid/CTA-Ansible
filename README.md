# Ansible Playbooks

This folder contains ansible playbooks to help setup Theta and Zeta from scratch. Ansible is a useful tool to programmatically configure servers.

Ansible strives to be idempotent, meaning that no matter how many times you run the playbook you’ll end up with the same result.

Warning: if running a playbook against a machine that’s already setup, settings like the cta user password will be changed to that in the playbook.

This presumes you're running Linux of some variety. 

### Prerequisites:
These packages need to be installed:
- `ansible` (for actually running the playbooks)
- `vagrant` (for creating / managing VMs for testing)
- `libvirt-daemon` / `virtualbox` (for actually running VMs)
- `nfs-common` (a requirement of the Vagrant Debian image)

(Warning: if your running on a fresh install of Debian the non-root user created whilst following the Debian GUI installer is NOT automatically added to sudoers. To do so run this:
```bash
su -c 'gpasswd -a $USER sudo'  # Swap $USER for actual name
```
)

```bash
sudo apt install ansible vagrant libvirt-daemon nfs-common
```

## Testing
Best way to test these playbooks is with vagrant as a method to create virtual machines (VMs) locally.

Move to temp folder
```bash
mkdir ./Testing
cd ./Testing
```

Grab debian image
```bash
vagrant box add debian/buster64
```

Create default config
```bash
vagrant init debian/buster64
```

Add / edit vagrant file to include relevant playbook
```bash
nano ./Vagrantfile
```
to then contain:
```
config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
        ansible.playbook = "zeta-playbook.yml"
    end
```

Create and start VM
```bash
vagrant up
```

Dial into the VM to have a play and test
```bash
vagrant ssh
```

## Execution / Installation
### Local prerequisites
- Ansible (for actually running the playbooks)

Install Debian (## Need to verify current version ##) on remote / target hardware with sane settings. Bare minimum requirements are ssh access and a user that belongs to sudo group.

Then it’s a case of use ansible to run the playbook with:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i 192.168.121.146, \  # Hosts to run on
 -u $USER_WITH_SUDO \   # User with sudo
 -k \               # Ask for SSH password
 -K \               # Ask for sudo password
 zeta-playbook.yml  # Playbook to run
```
